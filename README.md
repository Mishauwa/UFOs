# UFOs

## Overview of the project

In the project we want to display an in-depth analysis about UFO sightings and show the user on a webpage and with a dynamic table the occasions. The user will be able to filter the table after certain criteria. 


## Results

To perform a search the user has to follow below instructions. 

The webpage layout on the first page. 


Below you can see the table without any filter selected. 


You can either filter for date, city, state, country or shape. Enter either one or several of the filter criteria in the fields on the left hand side. Press enter or click off the input box. The dynamic table will show you the filtered results. 


## Summary

### Drawback

The user must know specific input criteria like e.g. the city name and has to spell it correctly. 

### Recommendations

1. The next addition should be to catch spaces at the end and accept also upper and lower cases.

2. Include a button to reset the filter and the table to the original state.
